## About me
At present time I'm on maternity leave and I think this is the best time to get new profession. I have little experience in web development. Now I'm studying the course [community Rolling Scope](https://rs.school/russia/). There is a huge amount of new information, and thanks to **my skills to focus and work hard** I can become a great front-end developer.

## Skill
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Git.
## Code example
```
function deepCount(a){
  let lengArr = 0;
  for (const elem of a) {
    (Array.isArray(elem))?lengArr += deepCount(elem) + 1:lengArr++;
  }
  return lengArr;
}
```
## Work Experience
I have just started studying the course, so I don't have any experience in this field.
